# Paper Proposal
My plan is to write a beginner guide to Pig or Hive. For which one I choose I will first start out explaining what they are and the pros and cons of using them. Then I will use a docker image and show some basic of Pig or Hive, and then take a csv file and extract the basic maximum, minimum, and average values per column.

Pig Docker: https://hub.docker.com/r/hakanserce/apache-pig/
Hive Docker:https://hub.docker.com/r/bde2020/hive/
